        <h1>Bender?! You stole the atom.</h1>
        <p>You're going to do his laundry? Why would I want to know that? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!</p>
        <p>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Bite my shiny metal ass. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! <strong> Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</strong> <em> I can explain.</em> It's very valuable.</p>
        <h2>That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</h2>
        <p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Oh sure! Blame the wizards!</li><li>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!</li><li>How much did you make me?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Leela's gonna kill me.</h3>
        <p>Soothe us with sweet lies. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Hey, whatcha watching?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.</li><li>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</li><li>Bender, we're trying our best.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</p>
        <p>And then the battle's not so bad? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Bender, quit destroying the universe! Ummm…to eBay?</p>
        <p>I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
        <p>Now what? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Actually, that's still true. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?</p>
        <p>Meh. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Anyone who laughs is a communist! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
        <p>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</p>
        <p>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. No, she'll probably make me do it. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
        <p>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
        <p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>
        <p>I wish! It's a nickel. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</p>
        <p>Ow, my spirit! No, she'll probably make me do it. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! No, I'm Santa Claus! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!</p>
